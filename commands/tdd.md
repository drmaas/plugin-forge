description: Tests-first implementation workflow with strict red-green-refactor discipline.
argument-hint: [--no-loop] [task description]
---

Run the devmode `/tdd` workflow.

First, parse loop flags and objective from the invocation:

```!
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/parse-loop-args.sh" $ARGUMENTS
```

Treat parser output as authoritative:

- `loop_mode=loop`: use standard Ralph Loop iteration.
- `loop_mode=no-loop`: run a single pass and hand off without iterative loop behavior.
- `task_objective=...`: use this as the objective text (do not treat `--no-loop` as objective content).

Use `devmode-builder` as the implementation owner with this contract:

1. Define or update tests first to produce a failing state.
2. Implement only enough changes to pass tests.
3. Refactor while preserving green tests.
4. Run full required checks and tests for touched components.
5. Hand off to `devmode-reviewer` for a verdict.

Load `devmode-tester` immediately. Use `devmode-coder` for implementation and `devmode-gatekeeper` before handoff.

If `task_objective` is non-empty, treat it as the active task objective.
