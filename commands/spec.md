description: Spec-driven workflow for requirements, phased tasks, traceable implementation, and review.
argument-hint: [--no-loop] [task description]
---

Run the devmode `/spec` workflow.

First, parse loop flags and objective from the invocation:

```!
bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/parse-loop-args.sh" $ARGUMENTS
```

Treat parser output as authoritative:

- `loop_mode=loop`: use standard Ralph Loop iteration.
- `loop_mode=no-loop`: run a single pass and hand off without iterative loop behavior.
- `task_objective=...`: use this as the objective text (do not treat `--no-loop` as objective content).

Use `devmode-builder` as the implementation owner with this contract:

1. Capture requirements and acceptance criteria.
2. Draft a concise specification (scope, interfaces, edge cases, validation strategy).
3. Decompose work into phased, atomic tasks with one in progress.
4. Implement against tasks with requirement traceability.
5. Validate and hand off to `devmode-reviewer`.

Load `devmode-orchestrator` and `devmode-architect` early, then `devmode-coder`, `devmode-tester`, and `devmode-gatekeeper` for execution and validation.

If `task_objective` is non-empty, treat it as the active task objective.
